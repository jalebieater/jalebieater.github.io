<strong>DESCRIPTION</strong>
<strong>Siddarth</strong> is a teminal tool/game from the 90s available for Linux
or BSD platforms, preferably Arch, Gentoo or OpenBSD.

most likely undesired behaviour.
Although <strong>Siddarth</strong> is device-independent best results are achieved on
Thinkpads.
<strong>Siddarth</strong> can also be used outdoor, mainly to explore abandoned buildings

(execution time can be further improved with the <strong>pizza</strong> or

<strong>-C/C++</strong>
